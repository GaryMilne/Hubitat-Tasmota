*  This driver is one of several in the Tasmota Sync series. (Bulb, Plug, Dual Outlet, Dimmer Switch, Switch with Fan, Switch with Sensor (Temp & Humidity). All of these drivers are very similar and much of the code is identical.
*  To simplifiy maintenance all of these drivers have two sections. Search for the phrase "END OF UNIQUE FUNCTIONS" to find the split.
*  #1 The top section contains code that is UNIQUE to a specific driver such as a bulb vs a switch vs a dimmer. Although this code is UNIQUE it is very similar between drivers.
*  #2 The bottom section is code that is IDENTICAL and shared across all drivers and is about 700 - 800 lines of code. This section of code is referred to as CORE.
*
*  DUAL SWITCH - UNIQUE - CHANGELOG
*  Version 0.91 - Internal version
*
*  CORE - IDENTICAL - CHANGELOG
*  All changes to code in the CORE section will be commented here. Changes to the UNIQUE section that are made across all drivers will also be commented here.
*  Version 0.91 - Internal version
*  Version 0.92E - Global rename of some variables
*  Version 0.93A - Enhancement of Tasmota rules to provide more granular data and less MEM usage. Although in the unique section this change was made across all drivers.
*  Version 0.93B - Enhancement of Tasmota rules to use only a single MEM register.
*  Version 0.94C - Tasmota rules moved to all VAR use, no MEM. Driver handles non-populated TSync fields.
*  Version 0.95A - Updates to parse to handle inTransaction logic and reject lan messages after timeout window has closed.
*  Version 0.95B - Added toggle function and state variables for lastOff and lastOn
*  Version 0.96A - Tweaks to formatting of logging.
*  Version 0.96B - Added logging enhancements with HTML tags. Added blue highlight to key fields in preferences.
*  Version 0.96C - Added handling for Tasmota "WARNING" message that occurs when authentication fails and possibly other scenarios.
*  Version 0.97 - Added option in settings to disable use of HTML enhancements in logging. These do not show correctly on a secondary hub in a two+ hub environment. This option allows them to be disabled.
*
* Authors Notes:
* You might be asking yourself, do we really need another Tasmota driver for Hubitat? It's a fair question as there are already multiple drivers available. By far the best is the "Tasmota Device Manager" by Markus Li.
* That said, the version by Markus is no longer supported and Markus has been banned from the Hubitat platform. I also found several other things about Markus' version to be limiting.
*  1) To use Markus' version you had to use a special compilation of Tasmota that introduced some Hubitat hooks for synchronisation. 
*     Tasmota Sync drivers retain the synchronization between Tasmota and Hubitat by using Tasmota rules to send sync requests whenever a change is detected on Tasmota. This requires version 11 or greater of Tasmota. Polling is also supported for earlier Tasmota versions.
*  2) Markus used a Parent\Child App\Driver architecture. Meaning that a simple Tasmota device like a Bulb or a Switch had two driver entries. I found this unweildy and cumbersome.
*     Tasmota Sync drivers are just that, drivers only. Each Tasmota device (IP address) will only have one entry in the driver table making it a little cleaner.
*  3) Markus' implementation was quite chatty and would sync on changes and at each TelePeriod (usually every 5 minutes). 
*     Tasmota Sync drivers only report on changes at the Tasmota device with the exception of the Power Management device which reports at the TelePeriod but ONLY if there has been a change.
*  4) I also found that Markus' drivers were not always complete such as setting colorTemperature on a bulb. Markus' code was also very dense making changes difficult when combined with the App\Parent\Child architecture. 
*     All features of Tasmota Sync drivers are fully operational and the code is more straightfoward and approachable to non veteran coders without comprimising reliability of the driver.
*
*  Lastly, I had previously written much of this code for the Smartthings Classic environment and carried forward some useful elements such as saving and recalling favorite color and CT values and full support for Tasmota Fade.
*  As Hubitat does not have the same UI that Smartthings Classic does, I've done some innovative things with logging that make it much easier to troubleshoot problems should some arise, and more fun to look at when they don't.
